        "**Ans:-**\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects rather than functions and logic.

        "**Ans:-**\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance is a fundamental OOP concept where a child class (subclass) inherits attributes and methods from a parent class (superclass). It promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",

        "**Ans:-**\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism (\"poly\" = many, \"morph\" = forms) is the ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in different ways. It allows one interface to represent different underlying forms (data types).\n",
        "\n",
        "It is of two types:\n",
        "1. Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism)\n",

        "- Not natively supported in Python (but possible with default args or *args).\n",
        "2. Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism)\n",
        "- Achieved via method overriding (subclass redefines a parent method).\n",
        "- Supported in Python and most OOP languages.\n",
        "\n",

        "- Flexibility: Same method name works across different classes.\n",

        "Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class) while restricting direct access to some components. In Python, encapsulation is achieved using:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Naming Conventions (to indicate \"private\" members).\n",
        "2. Property Decorators (@property, @attribute.setter) for controlled access.\n",
        "3. Name Mangling (limited private variables with __).\n",
        "\n",
        "** Encapsulation is used for**\n",
        "- Data Protection: Prevent accidental modification of critical data.\n",
        "- Validation: Ensure data integrity (e.g., negative balance check).\n",

        "\n",
        "**Ans:-**\n",
        "\n",
        "A constructor is a special method used to initialize an object when it is created. The most commonly used constructor in Python is the __init__() method.\n",
        "\n",
        "- It is called automatically when an object of a class is instantiated.\n",
        "- It is used to set initial values for object attributes or perform setup\n",

        "\n",
        "**Types of Constructor**\n",
        "- Default Constructor, if __init__() is not defined, Python provides a default constructor that does nothing.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Uses**\n",
        "- Instance Method is default for most cases (operates on instance data).\n",
        "- Class Method is used when we need to work with the class itself (e.g., factory methods).\n",

        "**Ans:-**\n",
        "\n",
        "Method overriding is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concept where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. The overridden method in the subclass replaces the parent class's implementation when called on a subclass object.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Only possible when a child class inherits from a parent class.\n",
        "- The method name, parameters, and return type must match the parent class method.\n",

        "The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent class in inheritance hierarchies. It plays a crucial role in method overriding, cooperative multiple inheritance, and maintaining clean, reusable code.\n",

        "\n",
        "The __del__ method is a destructor in Python, called when an object is about to be destroyed (garbage-collected) or it is going out of scope. However, its behavior is unpredictable and rarely used in practice.\n",
